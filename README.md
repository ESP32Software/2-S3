## Our Purpose...

The Esp32 product line is difficult to master on a large scale.  Espessif makes it a point to demonstrate all the topics in tiny little bit size portions.  No where do we see design patterns to explain how to be effective on a large scale with many devices and possibily dozens of tasks.

The repositories here will demonstrate all the required approaches to master a large scale Esp32 project successfully.  These solutions are compiled from about 4 years of trial and error and painful, time-consuming, learning.

At the heart of what we do is: Componentization, FreeRTOS, State-Model driven programming.
